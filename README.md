# SageTheme
**Improve your iOS Icons.**

Sage is a theme made to simplify iOS. It has been created by myself [CallumWeiss](http://twitter.com/callumweiss) to give a clean and simplistic look to your iDevice. This theme is mainly being created beacuse I wanted my device to look a certain way, I wanted a clean user experience that wasnt too heavy on the eyes and then Sage was born. Join me in creating a great user experience and with your feedback we can create something beautiful together.

**What does it include**
Fully re-designed stock iOS and App store icons.
